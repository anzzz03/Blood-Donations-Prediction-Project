# Blood-Donations-Prediction-Project
Blood transfusion is a crucial challenge in blood supply chain management, especially when there exists a high demand, but not enough blood inventory. By the means of this project, we aim to predict the likelihood of a blood donor donating blood again within a given window of time. The Blood Transfusion Service Center drives to different universities and collects blood as part of a blood drive. We want to predict whether or not a donor will give blood the next time the vehicle comes to campus. The data is structured according to RFMTC marketing model (a variation of RFM, commonly used in marketing for identifying your best customers). In this project, we make the use of TPOT library to find the best machine learning pipeline, which is a Python 
Automated Machine Learning tool that optimizes machine learning pipelines using genetic programming.
