# Blood-Donations-Prediction-Project
Blood transfusion is a crucial challenge in blood supply chain management, especially with the existence of high demand without sufficient blood inventory. This project was aimed at forecasting the probability of a donor making a repeat blood donation within a specified timeframe. The Blood Transfusion Service Center drives to universities and collects blood as a part of a blood drive. The goal is to predict whether a donor will donate blood the next time the vehicle comes to campus. The data is structured according to RFMTC marketing model (a variation of RFM, commonly used in marketing for identifying the best customers). Conducted data wrangling, splitting, and normalisation on the dataset and utilised Python, Pandas, and the TPOT library for model selection, ultimately identifying Multinomial Naive Bayes as the most effective model with an AUC score of 0.7637 and created a PowerPoint presentation to showcase the project's methodology, implementation process, and final insights.
